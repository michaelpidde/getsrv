                <h1>Hydroponics For The Simpleton</h1>
                <p>I believe that cultivating your own food is beneficial in many ways, some of which are practical, whereas others lean toward the philosophical and psychological. I by no means have as much experience as others, but over the past year or two (as of late 2021), I have acquired some first-hand experience in both traditional gardening as well as basic hydroponics. In this article I would like to outline some of the things that I have learned in particular about the latter method, as well as outlying concerns that I don't yet have answers to.</p>

                <h2>Materials</h2>
                <p>So far I have focused my efforts on the Kratky method of hydroponics. In short, it is a deep water culture method (that is, you have a reservoir of nutrient water that your plants roots are suspended in) that does not rely on a moving water source, and which I find easier to set up as an absolute beginner. It's not that other methods are conceptually harder to understand; rather, the Kratky method is just so <i>easy</i>.</p>
                <p>These are the materials that I use for my setup: <sup><a id="ref-1" href="#notes-1">1</a></sup></p>

                </ul>
                <p>You could easily get by without grow lights, but for my particular use case (growing in the basement) they're completely necessary. If you're in a dwelling with copious natural light and window space then that should be sufficient.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The process that I have been following occurs in two stages which I'll call <b>germination</b> and <b>mature growth</b>. I don't know if there are proper botanical terms for these stages, but since they involve distinct requirements, we'll operate under those titles.</p>
                <h3>Germination</h3>
                <p>In this stage the goal is to get the seeds to start growing within their rockwool home. I start by tearing off however many pieces of rockwool corresponding to the number of plants that I wish to try to grow. <sup><a id="ref-3" href="#notes-3">3</a></sup> The rockwool is placed into an aluminum drip tray; alternately, you could use a plastic takeout dish or some other shallow container that can hold liquid. The rockwood is wetted completely with tap water. I make no effort to figure out the pH level of my water or figure out what kind of habitat it is for any particular plant, but if you take interest in that level of detail then study up on the process and enjoy determining your locality's water ecosystem. After the rockwool is fully saturated (this only takes a moment), I expand the premade hole to make it easier to insert seed. I have most recently started inserting two seeds into each starter plug in an attempt to maximize germination potential and alleviate rockwool waste from a plug that has no success. I try to make sure that the seeds are pushed down to the bottom of the hole and are in good contact with the rockwool so that they maintain contact with moisture. A shallow amount of water is kept in the tray so that the rockwool does not dry out during this germination stage, and the tray is placed on my basement shelf under the grow light next to its big brother and sister plants.</p>
                <p>I have encountered different approaches to germination and am unsure which is the most effective, or what factors any method are dependent on. Some options include, but are probably not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No light exposure for a few days. I saw this in relation to micro greens being started in dirt, but I don't know how or if non-traditional substrates would make any difference.</li>
                    <li>Attempting germination as I do, whether closing the rockwool holes over the seeds or not. Closing the holes would potentially be the same effect as limited/zero light exposure.</li>
                    <li>Did you ever germinate seeds in a damp paper towel in a plastic bag haning in a sunny window in school? I did, and it worked very well. It was absolutely not a zero light method, and the temperature from the greenhouse effect was a factor.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can imagine, there are practical factors that go into successful germination. You will need to experiment with the conditions to see what yields the best results for your ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Depending on the type of plant being grown and the conditions of their entry into sprouthood, you may start to see plant tips popping out of the rockwool within a number of days. The germination time may be extended in colder climates, such as my basement. You will need to take care that the rockwool does not dry out during this stage; check daily and add more water in the tray as needed. I generally continue to use plain water for the duration of this stage, though a very small mixture of germination nutrient solution could be used. Read your nutrient instructions for precise instructions in this regard. Using the General Hydroponics Flora Series nutrients, this may be 1mL (from each bottle) into a gallon of water, but don't quote me on that. The idea, though, is to not overfeed your fragile sproutlings. The ultimate goal of this stage is to have an adolescent plant whose roots have started to extend through the bottom of the rockwool in search of water and nourishment. Once you see the roots, it's time to move to the next stage.</p>
                <h3>Mature Growth</h3>
                <p>The first step in this stage is to move the plants into their final homes. Taking as many net cups as there are successfully sprouted starter blocks, I add some clay balls in the bottom of each cup so when the starter block is placed inside it will be flush with the top of the net cup. I then pack in more clay balls around the rockwool to keep it in place in the center of the net cup. If both seeds have sprouted in the rockwool, this is the time to remove one of them by plucking the top off. I have seen other people carefully tear the rockwool in half and extricate the seedling so that the roots are attached and it can be replanted, but I don't bother with the amount of effort. I mainly work with lettuce its seeds are very plentiful.</p>
                <p>After all of the net cups are filled, I set them into mason jars. I will mix up some nutrient liquid in the formulation that I like, which is 5mL from each bottle into a 1 gallon milk bottle then filled with tap water. The mason jars are filled close to the top, making sure that the liquid level is high enough to contact the rockwool. The roots will eventually grow down past the clay balls, but care needs to be taken at this stage before the roots have travelled down. When filling the jars I pour the solution right onto the clay balls and rockwool as they're suspended inside the mason jar; I don't bother lifting the net cup out to fill the jar because I don't like guessing at how much liquid displacement there will be when the net cup is plunged into it.</p>
                <p>The last critical step is to wrap the mason jar in a protective covering that will keep light out. Water with minerals and whatever natural biological ecosystem it has mixed with light is a breeding ground for green sludge. Ideally you want to encourage the growth of the plant and discourage the growth of anything else. I use aluminum foil for this purpose and make sure to wrap it over the top of the net cup as well, as close to the plant as I feel comfortable doing, taking care that the fragile baby leaves are not stuck under the foil.</p>
